# Syracuse University CIS 735: Machine Learning for Cyber Security

Welcome to the official repository for Syracuse University's CIS 735 course: Machine Learning for Cyber Security. This repository contains source code, examples, and resources to help students understand the intersection of machine learning and cybersecurity.

## Course Overview

This course explores how machine learning techniques can be applied to cybersecurity challenges, as well as how to secure machine learning systems themselves. Through a combination of theoretical foundations and practical applications, students will develop the skills needed to implement and evaluate machine learning solutions for security problems.

## Learning Objectives

After taking this course, students will be able to:

- Understand basic principles of machine learning
- Understand threats to cybersecurity systems
- Understand how to detect and circumvent threats and attacks to systems using machine learning algorithms
- Understand how machine learning algorithms may be used to build cybersecurity systems
- Understand how to build secure machine learning algorithms (develop a basic understanding of how security of machine learning algorithms may be improved by including security constructs in the algorithms)
- Develop an understanding of interaction of machine learning and cyber security systems
- Develop an understanding of and build from current research literature in cybersecurity and machine learning

## Course Materials

### [Lecture 2: Bayes Theorem and Distributions](./Lecture_2_Bayes_Theorem_and_Distributions)
- Bayes Theorem examples (binary and continuous)
- Parametric density functions
- Non-parametric density estimation
- Semi-parametric density estimation with mixture models
